**Sample Mean**: $\tilde{X}=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i / n$, where $X_i$ is a data point
**Sample Median**: This is the middle observation where $X_i$'s are arranged numerically
**Sample Mode**: The most common value. 
**Sample Range**: $R=max_i(X_i)-min_i(X_i)$
**Sample Variance**: $S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i -\tilde{X})^2$ 
**Sample Standard Deviation**: $S=+\sqrt{S^2}$ 
**Quartile**: The three quartile partition the data into four equally sized counts or segments
- Lower quartile: 25% of the data is less than this
- Median: 50% of the data is less than this
- Upper quartile: 75% of the data is less than this
**IQR**: is equal to the upper quartile - the lower quartile
