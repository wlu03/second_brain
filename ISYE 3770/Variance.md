Variance is the measure of the dispersion or variability of probability $$\sigma^2 = Var(X)=E[(X-\mu)]$$ This the the average of the distance from all points within the set subtracted from the mean. Given a set of $s={x_1,x_2,x_3,...x_n}$, then the variance for a the set $s$ is $$\sum_{i=n}(x_i-\mu) / n$$
**Theorem**: $Var(X)=E[X^2]-\mu^2$.
**Properties**:
- $Var(aX+b)=a^2Var(x)$
- $Var(c)=0$ where $c$ is a constant
**Definition**: the standard deviation of X is $\sigma=+\sqrt{Var(x)}$
