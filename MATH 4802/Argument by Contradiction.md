> First the statement is assumed to be false. Then a sequence of logical deductions yields a conclusion that contradicts either the hypothesis (indirect method) or a fact known to be true (reductio ad absurdum). This contradiction implies the original statement must be true. 

**Euclid's Theorem**. There is a infinitely many primes. 
	Proof. Assume that there is a finite number of primes. List them as $p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5,...,p_n$. The number $N=p_1p_2p_3...p_n+1$ is divisible by a prime $p$ yet is [[Co-prime | coprime]] to $p_1,p_2,p_3,...,p_n$. Therefore, $p$ does not belong on the list of all prime numbers, a contradiction. Hence, the initial assumption was false, proving that there are infinitely many primes.
