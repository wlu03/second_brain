Coprime (or relatively prime) means that two integers share no common positive factors (divisors) other than **1**. In other words, their **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is **1**.

### Example:

- **8 and 15** are coprime because the only positive divisor they both share is 1.
- **12 and 18** are not coprime because their GCD is 6 (they share divisors like 2, 3, and 6).

Coprime numbers do not need to be prime individually; they simply need to have no common factors other than 1.
