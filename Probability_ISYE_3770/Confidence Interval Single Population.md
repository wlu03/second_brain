Instead of estimating a parameter by a point estimator alone give a random interval that contains the unknown parameter with a certain probability. 

**Example**
- $\bar{X}$ is a point estimator for the parameter $\mu$ 
- A 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ might look like $(L,U)$
It means that if we make 100 confidence interval for $\mu$ based on different random sample, then 95 of them will have the $\mu$ in them and just 5 of them don't contain $\mu$

**Definition**: A 100(1-a)% confidence interval for an unknown parameter $\theta$ is given by two random variables L and U satisfying $$P(L \le \theta \le U) =1-a$$
These variables are the lower and upper confidence limits. 

**Example** 
We are 95% sure that popularity of our product is $56\% \pm 3\%$. This means that 95% chance their product is within $[53\%,59\%]$.
