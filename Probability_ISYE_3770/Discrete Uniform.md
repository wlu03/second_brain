Where finite number of values are equally likely to be observed for every one of $n$ value has a equal probability of $1/n$

| x    | x_1 | x_2 | ... | x_n | sum |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| f(x) | 1/n | 1/n |     | 1/n | 1   |

$$pmf: f(x_i)=\frac{1}{n} \space for \space i=1,2,...,n$$
