This runs the same prompt on multiple inputs at the same time using threads. 

Use Case: 
You are running a classification or translation task on multiple inputs
``` python

def parallel(prompt: str, inputs: List[str], n_workers: int = 3) -> List[str]:
    """Process multiple inputs concurrently with the same prompt."""
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(llm_call, f"{prompt}\nInput: {x}") for x in inputs]
        return [f.result() for f in futures]

prompt = "Translate the following sentence to Spanish."
inputs = [
    "Hello, how are you?",
    "What time is the meeting?",
    "This is a beautiful day."
]

translated_results = parallel(prompt, inputs)
for i, res in enumerate(translated_results):
    print(f"\nInput {i+1}: {inputs[i]}")
    print(f"Output {i+1}: {res}")
```
