7. **Database of LinkedIn Users + Autoscraping Algorithm**
    - **Purpose**: Holds a large set of LinkedIn profiles or recruiter/hiring manager data.
    - **Key Function**: Uses an “autoscrapth” (or scraping) algorithm to find the most relevant people (e.g., recruiters, HR managers) based on job positions, industry, or keywords.
    - **Flow**:
        - Feeds relevant contact info to the LangChain/AI Service so it can generate targeted outreach emails.
