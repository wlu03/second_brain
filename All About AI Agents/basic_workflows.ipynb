      "This issue is clearly related to account access and authentication problems. The user is experiencing login difficulties with their password, which is a core account security and access issue. While there might be technical aspects involved, the primary concern is account access restoration. The urgency expressed by the user and the nature of the problem (password/login issues) makes this a typical account support case. Account team specialists are best equipped to handle password resets, account verification, and access restoration while following proper security protocols.\n",
