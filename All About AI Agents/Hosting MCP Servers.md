# How to Access Servers
To access public servers you don't talk to MCP servers using a REST endpoint. An MCP Client (e.g. Claude Desktop, etc.) opens a long-lived Server-Sent events (SSE) stream to the server's `/see` endpoint, then sends JSON encoded protocol messages (`list_tools` and `call_tools`) with HTTP post messages to `/messages`. The server keeps the stream open and stream the results back. It's still an HTTP format, but the pattern is bidirectional messaging rather than stateless request/response. **Local development** uses an stdio transport (clients spawns the server as a subprocess) while production remote servers are containerized and deployed like any other on web services with a lightweight Dockerfile or build/start command. 

## MCP wire protocol
**Transport** 
- *stdio*: Local Dev, Packaged Servers, Messages move over JSON over `stdin` and `stdout` streams
- HTTP + SEE: remote/cloud servers, Message are sent from client to server via HTTP Post and server to client by Server Sent Events stream (SSE).

The MCP spec defines two RPC method that every client needs to implement. 
- `list_tools`: server's tools and their JSON schemas 
- `call_tool`: invokes a tool with arguments and await streamed response
Both methods travel inside the JSON envelope described in the public spec; for HTTP/SSE servers you usually POST to `/messages` with a `sessionId` query param, then read the corresponding SSE stream on `/sse`.

SEE connection stays open, REST tools like `curl` or Postman can test MCP servers, but normally let MCP‑aware client SDK manage the session framing for you.

### Hosting Options
#### Local (stdio)
- **Python** – `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP; mcp = FastMCP("Math"); …; mcp.run()` then `mcp install server.py` in Claude Desktop. ​[Dev Shorts | Aravind Putrevu | Substack](https://www.devshorts.in/p/how-to-host-your-mcp-server)
- **Node/TS** – package the server with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, publish to npm, and users run it via `npx my‑mcp‑server`.​[Dev Shorts | Aravind Putrevu | Substack](https://www.devshorts.in/p/how-to-host-your-mcp-server)

#### Remote (HTTP + SSE) 
Remote servers wrap the same logic 
```
GET /sse        <- open sse stream
POST /messages  <- JSON body with MCP envelope
```

and deploy like any stateless web container:
- **Fly.io “single‑tenant”** pattern: one VM per user, orchestrated with `fly mcp wrap` + `fly machines`; supports autoscale / suspend when idle.​[Fly](https://fly.io/docs/blueprints/remote-mcp-servers/)
- **Render web service**: Build =`npm install && npm run build`, Start =`npm start`, environment variable `PORT` respected.​[Dev Shorts | Aravind Putrevu | Substack](https://www.devshorts.in/p/how-to-host-your-mcp-server)
- **Docker anywhere**: a two‑line Dockerfile (`FROM node:20-alpine …`) works because MCP has no special runtime needs. `fly launch` or `docker run -p 3000:3000` is enough.​[Fly](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
In every case the public URL (e.g., `https://web-extractor-j3jc.onrender.com`) is what you hand to the client SDK; it appends `/sse` automatically when you register the server.​

## Hosting MCP Servers Online
- Allows all clients to benefit
- Any LLM speaking MCP can reuse the same server

## Quick start checklist

1. **Write** your tool with `@mcp.tool` (Python) or `server.tool()` (TS).
2. **Choose transport**:
    - Local hack → call `mcp.run()` (stdio).
    - Production → wrap in Express/FastAPI and export `/sse` & `/messages` (SSE).
3. **Containerise** (`Dockerfile` or `fly mcp wrap`).
4. **Deploy** to Fly.io / Render / Vercel and note the base URL.
5. **Register** in your client’s config (Claude Desktop, OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain) with that URL.
Now any MCP‑aware LLM agent can discover your tools with `list_tools` and invoke them with `call_tool`—no bespoke REST paths required.

## Python Client (MCP Python SDK)
``` python
from uuid import uuid4
from mcp import ClientSession, SseServerParameters
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client   # pip install "mcp[cli]"

SERVER_URL = "https://weather-mcp.fly.dev"   # base URL
session_id  = str(uuid4())

params = SseServerParameters(
    url=f"{SERVER_URL}/sse?sessionId={session_id}",
)

async def main():
    async with sse_client(params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as sess:
            await sess.initialize()                 # handshake
            tools = await sess.list_tools()         # discover
            print("Available tools:", [t.name for t in tools])

            result_stream = await sess.call_tool(   # invoke
                "get-forecast",
                {"latitude": 33.7488, "longitude": -84.3877},
            )
            async for chunk in result_stream:
                print(chunk.content.text, end="", flush=True)

import asyncio; asyncio.run(main())

```

**Loading MCP agents in one line using LangChain**
```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
from mcp import ClientSession, SseServerParameters
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import asyncio, uuid

async def agent_run():
    params = SseServerParameters(
        url=f"https://weather-mcp.fly.dev/sse?sessionId={uuid.uuid4()}"
    )
    async with sse_client(params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as s:
            await s.initialize()
            tools = await load_mcp_tools(s)
            agent = create_react_agent(ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"), tools)
            print(await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "What’s the forecast for NYC tomorrow?"}))

asyncio.run(agent_run())

```

#### Security for Production
- Auth Headers - most public servers expect a bearer token on both `/sse` and `/messages`
- Timeouts - keep alives are sent every 25 seconds to ensure proxy doesn't cut idle SSE connections
- 
TLDR
- Open SEE stream and keep it open
- Post JSON-enveloped MCP messages
- Read the streamed event until `event: completion`


## Issues with SSE
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a handy tool for pushing real-time updates from the server to the client over a single, long-lasting HTTP connection. It’s simple and efficient for many situations where you only need to send data one way. Bu like any tech, SSE has some hidden risks and challenges that can trip you up if you’re not aware of them.

**Scalability**
One of the biggest issues with SSE is scalability. Since SSE keeps a constant connection open for each user, your server needs to manage every single one of those connections. And here’s the catch:most browsers have a limit on how many concurrent connections they’ll allow per domain.If your app starts attracting a lot of users, those connections can pile up fast, putting strain on your server and possibly leading to slowdowns or even crashes. To avoid running into this problem, you’ll need to plan your server setup carefully.This might mean using load balancers or optimizing how you handle connections.Keep an eye on your server load and connection counts so you can spot any issues before they become a real problem.

**Opportunity:** a **multiplexing gateway** that converts many SSE streams into a single HTTP/2 or WebSocket tunnel, plus autoscaling policies for Fly.io/Render. Medium posts and Ably docs outline the technical hurdles. Read more here: [[MCP Multiplexing Gateway for SSE]]

## Versioning & Compatibility
- **Breaking‑change chaos.** Servers rarely publish semantic versions; PulseMCP just shows a date stamp.​[PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Docs emerging, tools missing.** Posts like BytePlus’ “MCP package versioning” describe best practices but stop short of tooling.​[BytePlus](https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/541603?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Opportunity:** a **contract testing service** that runs diff‑based compatibility checks and gates upgrades on CI, plus a badge system clients can read at runtime.

## Cross‑Server Orchestration
- **Client‑side only.** Langflow and Flowise can _compose_ local flows, but orchestrating two remote MCP servers in a single transaction still requires bespoke glue.​[Langflow](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-mcp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/issues/2291?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Opportunity:** a **server‑side orchestrator** that exposes “composite tools,” chaining calls across servers with rollback, parallel fan‑out, and caching—transparent to the LLM.

## Self‑Hosting & Serverless Auto‑Scale
- **Scale‑to‑zero missing.** LibreChat roadmap lists “cold‑start containers,” but nothing shipped yet.​[LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/blog/2025-02-20_2025_roadmap?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Opportunity:** a template that wraps any stdio MCP binary in a 1‑click Fly.io Machine or AWS Lambda container that starts on demand, caches tool schema in Deno KV, then shuts down.

## Mobile / Offline UX
- Every major UI is desktop‑first; none cache tool schemas for offline work or expose a PWA.
- **Opportunity:** a lightweight **mobile PWA** that syncs tool registries and runs local stdio servers (e.g. whisper, image‑gen) via WebAssembly, falling back to cloud when online.
