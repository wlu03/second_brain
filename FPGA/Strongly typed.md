A **strongly typed language** enforces strict rules on how different data types interact, preventing implicit type conversions that could lead to unpredictable behavior. In strongly typed languages, operations between incompatible types require explicit conversion, ensuring type safety.

**Characteristics of Strongly Typed Languages:**
• **Strict type enforcement:** Variables must adhere to their declared types.
• **No implicit type coercion:** Operations between incompatible types require explicit conversion.
• **Compile-time or runtime type checking:** Errors related to type mismatches are caught early.

**Examples of Strongly Typed Languages:**
• **Python** (though dynamically typed, it does not allow implicit type coercion)
• **Java**
• **C#**
• **Rust**
• **Haskell**

**Weakly Typed Languages:**
In contrast, weakly typed languages allow implicit type conversions. Examples include **JavaScript** and **PHP**, where "5" + 2 results in "52" instead of an error.
