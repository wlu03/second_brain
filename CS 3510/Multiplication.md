The product of two complex numbers
$$(a+bi)(c+di)=ac-bd+(bc+ad)i$$ can be done in three instead of four real number multiplication $$bc +ad=(a+b)(c+d)-ac-bd$$
## Regular Multiplication

Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are two $n$-bit integers, and assume for convenience that $n$ is a power of 2. As the first step toward multiplying $x$ and $y$, split each of them into their left and right halves, which $n/2$ bits long.
