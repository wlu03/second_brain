    "The following is the recursion tree built from this graph. If we were to mark the steps we entered and exited explore for a node, we’d get the numbers below. We want to see all nodes, but we’re missing I, J, and K. This is because there are disconnected components in the graph. Similarly if we started at K, we would not reach much of the graph. To achieve this, we simply loop over nodes on top of this.\n",

Get the keySet() from a HashMap representation of an adjacency list or just use `for vertice in sorted(graph)` to iterate through all vertice. We can keep a set to contain all vertice that have been explored. The following graph that has the post and pre labels would look the image below.\n",
