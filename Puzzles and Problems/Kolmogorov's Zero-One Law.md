>This theorem states that given a sequence of independent events $A_1,A_2,...$ in a probability space ($\Omega, \mathbb{F}, \textbf{P})$, events residing in the tail field of this sequence occur with a probability of either zero or one.

## Applications
____
The presence of an infinite connect component in randomly generated subgraphs of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ the coordinate plane. Depending on percolation parameter $p$, an infinite connected component occurs with probability zero or one. The critical parameter is $p=\frac{1}{2}$. An infinite component occurs with probability one if $p \ge \frac{1}{2}$ and zero if $p<\frac{1}{2}$.
