An tree or $k$-ary tree is a tree such that each node has no more than $k$ children. For example, a binary tree has a $k=2$ or ternary tree has a $k=3$. If $p<\frac{1}{k}$, then the number of $N_m$ of levels $m$ vertices connected to the root satisfies $E_p(N_m)\rightarrow 0$. This means that with a probability of 1, the cluster of the root is finite. For the cluster of roots to be finite, $p\ge \frac{1}{k}$ where $E_p(N_m)\rightarrow \infty$
