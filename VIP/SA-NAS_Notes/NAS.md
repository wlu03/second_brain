Neural Networks models used for object detection have 100+ million parameters used for training and evaluating take 1200 hours for a single architecture. In this team we build a autoML pipeline using an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm to automate the search. 

Surrogate evaluators are used to predict model performance and reduce the number of individuals having to be trained to get a good solution.
