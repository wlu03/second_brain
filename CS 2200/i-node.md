Every file has a unique name associated with it called **i-node** number. This number is an index into a table that has all information associated with the file. As UNIX systems evolved, the complexity of the information associated with each file increase (i.e. longer names). The collection of i-nodes forms a logical table and the i-node number is the unique disk block address that indexes into the logical table that contains information/attributes regarding that file. The storage manager may implement the free list of data blocks on the disk as bit vector. This is used to indicate whether a particular i-node is currently in use or not.
