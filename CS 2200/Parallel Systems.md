# pthreads (C)
___
Using multiple threads in a program enables **multithreading**, a technique to improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks (like sorting large arrays) and I/O-bound tasks (such as reading/writing files). Multithreading enables parallel execution on multi-core CPUs, enhancing performance. Thread terminates when main() terminates or when the thread's top-level procedure terminates. A threads starts its execution at some top level procedure is part of the same program.
