We should consider loading values into registers before computing them. It uses more instructions but it saves memory accesses because we can reuse the values.

Addressing modes refers to way the operands are specified in an instruction

Operand Granularity
char 8bit byte
short 16bits half word
int 32 bits word 
long 64 bits 
*word size in architecture can be int=16 or long=32 and other can happen*

## [[Operand Alignment]]
```
struct {
	char a;
	char b[3];
}
```
[b[3], b[2], b[1], a]
103, 102, 101, 100 
At address 100 stores byte a.

```
struct {
	char a;
	int b;
}
```

The arrays are in length 4. Thus to access 1, its 1 x 4 = 4.

## [[Endianness]]
![[Pasted image 20240822083725.png]]Depending on architecture, it can be either at 100 or 103.

The least significant bit comes first.
