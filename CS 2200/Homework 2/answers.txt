Question 1
----------
lea	$at, return
beq	$zero, $zero, jump

return:
	ra contains the address here





jump:
	my target address is here

## I must replicate jalr where

## RA <- PC + 1
## PC <- AT

## Idea: I can use a label for the return address and store using LEA. Then I must jump to
## the AT, the target address. Assuming that the register t0 has the target address, I will
## just use beq to jump to the target address or use a label to jump.
