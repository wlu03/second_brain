*Example*
The mean contents of coffee cans filled on a particular production line are being studied. Standards specify that the mean contents must be 16.0 oz, and from past experience it is known that the standard deviation of the can contents is 0.1 oz. The hypotheses are
$H_0: \mu = 16.0$
$H_1: \mu \ne 16.0$ 

A random sample of nine cans is to be used, and type I error probability is specified as a=0.05. What is the type II error if the true mean contents are $µ_1$=16.1 oz or β(16.1)?

1. Null Hypothesis $H_0:\mu=16.0$
2. Alternative Hypothesis $H_1: \mu \ne 16.0$
3. Standard Deviation: $0.1oz$
4. Sample size (n): 9
5. Significant level ($\alpha$): 0.05
6. True mean $\mu_1: 16.1oz$
7. $\delta = \mu_1-\mu_0=0.1$

Type II Error Probability is computed using the formula: $$\beta =\Phi(Z_{a/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma})-\Phi(-Z_{a/2}-\frac{\delta\sqrt{n}}{\sigma})$$
$$\beta=14.92\%$$
