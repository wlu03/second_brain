holds the base physical address of the page table for the currently running process. During a **content switch** the Page Table Base Register needs to updated. This is because each process has its own separate **page table**. The page table contains mappings from the virtual address and the physical memory frames. When the operating system switches from one process to another (content switch), the CPU needs to know which page table to use for memory access. This is why **PTBR** is important.
